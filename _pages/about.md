I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Luxembourg, working at LISER (Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research). My research focuses on labor supply, social choice, inequalities, and optimal taxation. I am particularly interested in ex-ante policy analysis and structural models that assess the impact of various policy interventions before they are implemented. One of the key tools I utilize in my research is **EUROMOD**, a tax-benefit microsimulation model, which I use to conduct detailed analyses of the distributive effects of fiscal policies across the European Union.

Under the supervision of [Fran√ßois Maniquet](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=cQR8M6IAAAAJ&hl=fr), my current research builds theoretical and empirical models to examine how labor supply decisions are shaped by the interplay between personal preferences and job opportunities. I am working to refine structural models of labor supply to include heterogeneity in preferences and job sets, with a focus on understanding the implications of these factors for inequality and optimal taxation.

In addition to my work on labor supply and social choice theory, my research explores how taxation can be optimally designed to reduce inequality while respecting individual freedom. My recent projects have also examined how compensatory policies can be developed to address inequalities resulting from unequal job opportunities.

Before pursuing my PhD, I obtained my Master's degree in 2021 from [HSE Moscow](https://www.hse.ru/en/) in the Economics Research program. My Master's thesis focused on the **economic impact of refugee inflows on host economies**, where I examined how large-scale migration affects labor markets, public finances, and welfare outcomes in receiving countries. This experience helped shape my current focus on economic inequalities and social welfare.

I continue to collaborate on applied research projects that explore the economic effects of various labor market policies, with a strong emphasis on the use of structural models and microsimulation techniques.
